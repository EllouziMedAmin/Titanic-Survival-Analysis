# Titanic Survival Analysis

This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a logistic regression model.

## Data

- **Passenger Class**
- **Gender**
- **Age**
- **Fare**
- **Family Size**
- **Embarked**

## Steps

1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Logistic Regression Model
5. Evaluation of Model Performance

## Results

- Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of **X%**.
- Visualizations like age distribution, survival rates by gender and class, etc.
